# Python Timer

Run the `timer.py` script and input the desired time in one of the following formats:
- `hh:mm:ss` (hours, minutes, and seconds)
- `mm:ss` (minutes and seconds)
- A plain number representing seconds

Ensure you have `pygame` installed and an audio file named `alarm.mp3` in the same directory as the script.
